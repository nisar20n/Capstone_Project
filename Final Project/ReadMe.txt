Run the scripts from Final Project folder named: Avionics_tool and RPM  using an IDE. Running from command line might not work for some of the functions such as Real-time plot etc. You need to add an image to the directory and name it "sensor_1.jpg" otherwise will show an error as this image is used in the mainwindow. Also, need to place text files in the directory that you want to analyze.

Better to use any Python IDE like Spyder to run the scripts.
